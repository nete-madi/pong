# pong - made with MonoGame
Basic game of Pong, built with MonoGame 3.8.

### To play:
- Download the release zip [here](https://github.com/nete-madi/pong/releases).
- Unzip the directory and run Pong.exe. Make sure it stays in the directory -- the executable won't work without access to the Monogame framework and libraries in that folder.
- Find a friend to play with.
- Use W/S to move the left paddle up and down, and use the up and down arrow keys to move the right paddle up and down.
- Hit the ball past the other person's paddle to score.
